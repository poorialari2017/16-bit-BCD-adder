## Description

This project implements a **16-bit Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) Addition Algorithm** originally written in **8086 Assembly**.  
The algorithm performs digit-by-digit addition on packed BCD numbers, applying correction (`+6`) when a nibble exceeds `9`, and properly manages carry propagation across all four digits.

It has been preserved for **educational and archival purposes**, and a newer version of the same algorithm — rewritten with structured pseudocode and documentation — is now available.
